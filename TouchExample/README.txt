This directory contains the original Android scribble app code, the broken, relatively featureless version that 
students are tasked to fix, improve, and explore. 

The actual code files are found in app/src/main/java/com/example/touchexample, and SingleTouchEventView.java is
the main file for students to modify. 

This directory should be added to C:\Users\[username]\AndroidStudioProjects, which may need to be created.
